# Bank-Loan-Portfolio-Analysis-Reporting-SQL-MS-Excel
This project focuses on building a comprehensive, data-driven Bank Loan Report to monitor lending activities, assess portfolio health, and identify key operational trends. The methodology leverages SQL for precise data preparation and Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables) for analysis, validation, and dynamic dashboard creation.

## Project Objective
To develop an interactive and insightful Bank Loan Report with two main dashboards: Summary and Overview. This report serves as a strategic tool for optimizing lending decisions and portfolio management by:
1. Evaluating Portfolio Health by classifying loans into 'Good Loans' (Fully Paid, Current) and 'Bad Loans' (Charged Off).
2. Monitoring Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), including funded amounts, received payments, interest rates, and Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios.
3. Analyzing Time and Segment Trends using Month-to-Date (MTD), Month-over-Month (MoM) metrics, and segmentation by demographics and loan characteristics.

## Dataset and Technology Used
1. Bank Loan Dataset - <a href="https://github.com/Likith-Business-Analytics/Bank-Loan-Portfolio-Analysis-Reporting-SQL-MS-Excel-/blob/main/BANK%20LOAN%20DATASET.xlsx">Dataset</a>
2. SQL: Used for the precise calculation of all required KPIs, including complex MTD/PMTD and Good/Bad Loan aggregations. All source queries are provided in the <a href="https://github.com/Likith-Business-Analytics/Bank-Loan-Portfolio-Analysis-Reporting-SQL-MS-Excel-/blob/main/SQLQuery1.sql">SQL Queries</a> And <a href="https://github.com/Likith-Business-Analytics/Bank-Loan-Portfolio-Analysis-Reporting-SQL-MS-Excel-/blob/main/BANK%20LOAN%20REPORT%20SQL%20QUERY%20DOCUMENT.docx">BANK LOAN REPORT SQL QUERY DOCUMENT</a>
3. Microsoft Excel: Employed for generating dynamic dashboards, visual analysis, and critically, using Pivot Tables to validate and verify all final report figures against the raw outputs generated by the SQL queries.- <a href="https://github.com/Likith-Business-Analytics/Bank-Loan-Portfolio-Analysis-Reporting-SQL-MS-Excel-/blob/main/BANK%20LOAN%20DATASET.xlsx"> Bank Loan Portfolio Analysis</a>

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 
**Dashboard 1: Summary & Portfolio Health KPIs:**
Core Financial and Application Metrics. These KPIs are tracked overall, Month-to-Date (MTD), and with Month-over-Month (MoM) comparison:
- Total Loan Applications: The total number of loan applications received.
- Total Funded Amount: The total value of funds disbursed as loans.
- Total Amount Received: The total repayments received from borrowers.
- Average Interest Rate: The average interest rate across all loans.
- Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio: The average borrower DTI ratio, used to assess financial health.

**Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs:**
Loans are classified as 'Good Loans' (status: 'Fully Paid' and 'Current') or 'Bad Loans' (status: 'Charged Off') to assess portfolio quality.

*Good Loan Metrics:*
- Good Loan Application Percentage
- Good Loan Applications (Total count)
- Good Loan Funded Amount (Total principal disbursed)
- Good Loan Total Received Amount (Total repayments)

*Bad Loan Metrics:*
- Bad Loan Application Percentage
- Bad Loan Applications (Total count)
- Bad Loan Funded Amount (Total principal disbursed)
- Bad Loan Total Received Amount (Total repayments)

*Loan Status Grid View Metrics:*
A detailed view that breaks down performance across all specific Loan Status categories, including:
- Total Loan Applications
- Total Funded Amount
- Total Amount Received
- MTD Funded Amount
- MTD Amount Received
- Average Interest Rate
- Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio

**Dashboard 2: Overview and Segmentation KPIs**
This dashboard provides visual, segmented analysis of the loan portfolio using three core metrics for comparison: Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received.
- Monthly Trends by Issue Date: Displaying monthly variations to identify seasonality and growth patterns.
- Regional Analysis by State: Visualizing lending activities across different regions.
- Loan Term Analysis: Illustrating the distribution of loans across various term lengths (e.g., 36 months, 60 months).
- Employee Length Analysis: Showing how borrower employment duration influences loan volume.
- Loan Purpose Breakdown: Presenting a breakdown of loans based on borrower motivations (e.g., Debt Consolidation, Credit Card Refinancing).
- Home Ownership Analysis: Displaying loan distribution based on borrowers’ home ownership status (Own, Rent, Mortgage).

## Process
- Data Loading and Cleaning: Ensured data consistency and integrity for type, format, and values.
- SQL Query Development: Developed specific SQL queries to aggregate and calculate all required KPIs (Total, MTD, PMTD, Good/Bad Loan metrics) and segmented data.
- Data Extraction: Exported SQL results into tables/views for import into Microsoft Excel.
- Pivot Table Creation & Validation: Created Pivot Tables in Excel for all required analyses and verified the dashboard figures against the raw SQL output to ensure the accuracy of the final report.
- Dashboard Assembly: Integrated all Pivot Tables and charts into two dynamic dashboards (Summary and Overview) using slicers for interactive filtering.

## Project Insight
1. Portfolio Health: The report shows that 86.17% of the loan portfolio is categorized as 'Good Loans' (Fully Paid or Current).
2. Risk Correlation: Loans with a 'Charged Off' status (Bad Loans) have a higher average interest rate (13.88%) and a higher average DTI (14.00%) compared to 'Fully Paid' loans (Avg Int Rate: 11.64%, Avg DTI: 13.17%).
3. Time Trend: There was a Month-over-Month increase in loan applications (6.91%) and Total Funded Amount (13.04%) from the previous month (November) to the current month (December 2021).
4. Lending Purpose: Debt Consolidation is the primary loan purpose, accounting for the highest number of applications (18,214) and total funded amount.

## Final Conclusion
The Bank Loan Report successfully established a strategic monitoring tool. By distinguishing between 'Good' and 'Bad Loans' and providing deep dives into performance across key dimensions—including term, employment, purpose, and ownership—the bank can use these insights to optimize pricing strategies, adjust risk tolerance, and allocate lending resources more efficiently to maintain a healthy portfolio.
